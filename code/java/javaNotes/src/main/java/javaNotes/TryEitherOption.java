    Option[T]
    - use it when you donâ€™t care about the exact cause
    - null or absent values, or failed validation can fail
    - Getting some data that might not be there,
    - Validation logic
    Either[L,R] or Result[Success | Failure]
    - similar use case as Option but when you do need to provide some information about the error.
    Try[T]
    - use when something Exceptional can happen that you cannot handle in the function.
    - This, in general, excludes validation logic and data retrieval failures but can be used to report unexpected failures.
