## Tips for good writing
https://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/writing-technical-posts/

Focus on skim headlines
Focus on First line of paragraph 
Lots of examples how people learn
Tell them why this is a good solution, not just how, how without why is a contrived solution (tutorial for tutorial sake)
