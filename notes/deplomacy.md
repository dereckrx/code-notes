## 
A diplomatic dialoge scene is about domination. Who is dominate? Who wins the scene?
- each actor wants something, and they are in conflict 
- Like a wrestling match, you must pin your opponent and get them to tap out 
- Like poker, however, you don't have to be stronger or actually have good cards
- but only convice your opponent that you do
- Friendly or hostile dialoge: threats, insults, 
- Compromises or compliments bring it back into friendly territory

Tug of war
- strength of arguments sets the inital position: one side favored or in the middle
- actions pull it one way or the other

You should tell me where the artifact is
- has no starting reason to tell you
- so starts out in their favor 
- You offer a bribe, to get them interested and they are susseptable to it
- They still wonder why they should help you?


Body of Argument: starting HP, starting bet in poker
Points: add strength to your argument
Bluff: threaten
if you have information you can use against someone
Raise: 
- threaten, intimidate (with the cards to back it up)
- Bribe, 
Bluffs: 
- attempt to threaten, intimidate (without good cards)
- lie: lie about facts, a bribe, that would convince them 
- blackmail: lie about information
Demand Bribe, Information, 
Posture/Confidence
Hesitate
Interupt/Talk over

Compliments and Insults
- vain or weak

Character/Emotion vs Argurment (you can attack either)
Each character must keep their cool in order to win
Affraid/Flight <---> Angry/Fight
- if actor becomes affaid or enraged, they lose the argument 
Friendly <-----> Hostile
- if dialoge becomes hostile, 
    - the argument can not be won
    - if actor is angry, the argument might be lost and their could be a fight
Argument: tug of war
against/disagree <----> for/agree
- if one side fills up, they win


A stronger argument can be beaten by a character attack



## Body of argurment 
hitpoints for your argument 
will + skill successes 

example: 
- Will: B4 => 4
- Oratory Skill: rolls 3 successes
- total: body of argument is 7

Oratory
Ediquette
Ugly Truth

Will Success are subtracted from the oponents attack 

### Dismiss: Finishing move
Conclusion to an argument, I know I've got him cornered
Counter by: Rebuttal
Add +2 dice to skill attack
- if fails, hesitate for the next volley 

### Feint: dummy point and then counter attack
Counters: Rebuttal
Defends against: Obfuscate

## Example

subtract 2D defend from point 3D attack
then roll 4D reposte, and apply damage to arguement
